In this assignment I selected INTERNSHALA website for web scraping ther is a problem with this website to get specific internship we have to 
iterate over multiple web pages it may have sometimes morethan 200 
So to reduce the work of the user we will scrap the all pages at once and stored in the database
And data can be retrived easily from the database

To get the service avail
First step:

   we have to scrap the details from the website and store it in the database.
   for that to happen run the commands.
   1) go build main.go
   2) ./main


Second step:

   To retrive the content from the database first we have to on the server and open the web-link and retrive the data.
   
   1)go build server.go
   
   2)./server
   
Finally you can choose any browser and enter the link (http://localhost:8080/newedit) .
